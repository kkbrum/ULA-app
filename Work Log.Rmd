Researching on matching algorithms, R implementations
#### 5/19/18 16:00-17:00
Getting `matchingMarkets` and all dependencies installed on my machines. Major issues with `rJava` (make sure that same type of R and Java installed ex. 64-bit R with 64-bit Java, and do an R restart after Java reinstall) 
#### 5/21/18 08:15-09:15
Reviewed current state of `Student.R` and made a list of bugs that need to be addresssed.
#### 5/22/18 08:30-09:30
Created more in depth options for inputting grade for student meta data, played around with a different numeric input type for year (more trouble than it's worth in terms of error checking), was working on an error message, but it doesn't play nicely with `req()`, so there was limited success
