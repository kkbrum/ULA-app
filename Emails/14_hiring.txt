Hi Karen!

Sorry for the delay in getting this information to you, but we have attached a spreadsheet of all the confirmed ULAs and their courses, netids, and emails for this semester. These students are all ready to be hired-- thank you so much for your hard work!

Additionally, _____ is seeking more ULAs, so there may be more students to hire in the coming week or so for these classes as they find more students.

Let us know if you need anything else!
