Dear Professor _________,

This semester the S&DS Department will continue using the online system for ULA assignment that takes into consideration student and faculty preferences. You can access the system and rank the students interested in ULAing your course by going to http://www.stat.yale.edu:3838/ULA/ and logging in with ___ as your username and _____ as your pin. You will have until the end of day on _________ to submit your preferences.

Instructions are outlined on the ranking page, but essentially you will be asked to rank any student you would be willing to have ULA your class from most preferable to least preferable (with no ties). If you do not know any of the students, you are encouraged to talk with other professors who may have taught them in the past or not submit a faculty ranking, in which case assignment will be based on student preferences and administrative input.

If you encounter any issues with the website or have any questions please contact thomas.bischoff@yale.edu and nick.marwell@yale.edu.

Best,
______________
