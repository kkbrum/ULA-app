Hi Professor ____________,

I hope this email finds you well!

We are working on assigning ULAs for your class. One of the people we had originally assigned dropped out, and we unfortunately have not found a student to fill this spot. We currently have ________ (email: ___________) and ________ (email: _____________) assigned to the class (they have already accepted their positions). While we originally advertised to all S&DS majors for the ULA application, please feel free to reach out to past students and see if anyone else is interested. If you do find an additional ULA, please let us know so that we can add them to the list of students to hire.

All the best,
