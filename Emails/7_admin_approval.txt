Hi ______ and _________,

I hope that this message finds both of you well!

I wanted to let you know that preliminary ULA matchings are now available for review at http://www.stat.yale.edu:3838/ULA/. 

_________'s login credentials:
username: __________
pin: __________

________'s login credentials:
username: ________
pin: ____________

It would be great if ULA assignments could be finalized by ___________, so that we can have assignment decisions released on __________ as originally planned. While you both have individual logins only one of you should submit the final assignments (the file will just get overwritten on the later submit). 

We're happy to hop on an audio call if that's at all helpful to get this finalized and are available via email throughout the day. 

Thanks and let me know if I can be helpful in any way!

All the best,
