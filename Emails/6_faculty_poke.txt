Hi __________,

I hope that this message finds you well!

I wanted to remind you that you can now rank your preferences for S&DS _____ using the online system. You can find the site at http://www.stat.yale.edu:3838/ULA/ and login with the following credentials:
Username: ______
Pin: ______

Your rankings are important for assigning the ULAs to the department's other courses, so it would be immensely helpful if you could do this ASAP. Thanks and please don't hesitate to let Katherine and I know if we can be helpful with any aspect of this process!

All the best,
_____________
