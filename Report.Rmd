# Overview
This year, the Yale S&DS Department the Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) program in many of its classrooms. Students serving as ULAs have both grading and teach responsibilities and serve in very similar capacities to the department's graduate student TAs and TFs. One problem currently facing the ULA program is the fact that no system currently exists to organize the recruitment and class assignment processes, which is frustrating for students applying to be ULAs, faculty hoping to have ULAs in their classrooms, and administrators who oversee the process and hire students. As more and more departments adopt the ULA program there will be a greater need for an organized (and potentially centralized) system to manage recruitment and assignment. This Shiny application is a first attempt at doing just that.[^1] 

# Current Progress

## Katherine
- Created log in functionality for both students and faculty. For students, this loads in their previous responses. For faculty, this creates a tab for each class they are teaching and loads in the information from the students who ranked that class and enables the faculty to rank those students. I also added error messages for the various log in failures.
- Helped Margaret and Cameron set up the inputs in the student ranking table so that they are interpreted by RShiny correctly and also made it possible to enable and disable inputs based on previous inputs.
- Helped debug and merge other peoples' code together.
- Helped plan the course of the project, adding issues to the git as necessary to guide peoples' work.

## Maria
- Set up basic initial structure for the student side of the application by creating the tabs that are used to collect student meta-data, record their course preferences, and summarize their inputs and set up all numeric and text fields on the meta-data tab. 
- Created basic error checks for all tabs of the student side of the application to ensure that responses are non-blank and follow the correct input format (ex. 4-digit pin is actually 4 digits.) When input is not correct students see an error message or warning and they may only submit their application, which writes to their personal preferences csv, when all input issues have been resolved.
- Helped debug and merge other peoples' code together.
- Helped plan the course of the project by contacting administrators, creating a paper outline of the general structure of the app, organizing team meetings, and adding issues to the git as necessary to guide peoples' work.

## Margaret
- Worked on the student's preferences page with Cameron. This involved displaying the courses available as a table (information pulled from a csv) and creating a selection button below to allow students to choose the classes they would like to ULA. Once the student submits their course selections, a csv (called temp.csv) is created to hold this information. This csv is immediately read to create a ranking table with the correct number of rows for the number of courses selected. 
- With Katherine's help, built a student information input table that collected data in the correct form (numeric for what year they've taken the class/preference ranking, character for typed in inputs, etc.) and correct ranges of values for numeric inputs. I also worked on adjusting the enabling of inputs - students must first select whether or not they have taken a course before being able to fill out any further information on the table.
- A feature that still needs to be worked on is allowing students to submit their information once it has all been correctly filled in and writing the information to the temporary csv that originally only contained the courses selected (error messages pop up if this has not been correctly satisfied and no csv is written).
- Another feature to be added is an autofill feature (the same as the Student meta-data page) where if a student signs in, all of the information a previous session that was saved to a csv is pulled into the App and automatically fills in the Student Preference page.
