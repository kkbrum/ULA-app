# ULA-app

## Background
This year, the Yale S&DS Department adopted the Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) program in many of its classrooms. ULAs have both grading and teaching responsbilities and serve in very similar capacities to graduate student TAs/TFs.

## Problem
No system currently exists to organize the ULA recruitment and class assignment processes. The protocol that is currently in place is inefficient and the process is frustrating for students applying to be ULAs, faculty hoping to have ULAs in their classrooms, and administrators who oversee the process/hire students.

## General Overview (Project Structure)
* Student Interface
    * Students provide basic information about themselves and the courses that they've taken
    * Students rank their preferences in therms of classes that they would like to ULA
* Faculty Interface
    * Faculty see the names and meta-data of students interested in ULAing their class (minus student preferences)
    * Faculty ranks students to be their ULAs according to their preferences
* Stable Matching Algorithm
* Administrator Interface
    * Administrator observes matching algorithm results and decide on final arguments.
